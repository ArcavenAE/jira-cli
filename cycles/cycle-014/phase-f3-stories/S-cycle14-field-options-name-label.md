  (D-381, 2026-09-25 F2 review), rebased on STORY-C. READ-SIDE ONLY per the
  F1 human gate (D-378, 2026-09-24): the originally-proposed WRITE-side
  companion fix (find_option_match/resolve_option_value name-fallback in
  src/cli/issue/field_resolve.rs) was REMOVED from scope after a
  fresh-context audit REFUTED its reachability -- system-typed fields never
  reach that code path (schema.field_type is priority/resolution/issuetype/
  securitylevel, never "option"). That capability gap is tracked separately
  as drift item FIELD-SYSTEM-TYPES-UNSUPPORTED, out of scope here.

# S-cycle14-field-options-name-label -- `jr field options` system-field label fallback (#861, read-side only)

## Narrative

- **As a** `jr field options <field>` user enumerating a system field's allowed values (e.g. `priority`, `components`, `versions`, `issuetype`)
- **I want to** see the field's real display name instead of `"(unnamed)"` (table) / `null` (JSON)
- **So that** `jr field options` is usable for system-typed fields, not just custom select fields, without changing the rendering contract for genuinely-nameless entries

## Behavioral Contracts

| BC | Role | Clauses this story implements |
|----|------|-------------------------------|
| BC-X.14.001 | PRIMARY (amended, cycle-014 F2) | The `value`-else-`name` presence-based label-resolution fallback (Behavior), the "Scope boundary -- READ-SIDE ONLY" paragraph, the "M3 is UNCHANGED and ALREADY CORRECT" paragraph, Edge Cases EC-X.14.001-8..13 |
| BC-X.14.003 | CROSS-REF (amended, cycle-014 F2, COUNT-NEUTRAL) | The UPDATED blockquote clarifying the rendering contract (`(unnamed)`/`null` for `None`) is unchanged -- only the upstream normalizer produces fewer `None` labels |

**Anchor justification:** BC-X.14.001 is the sole BC governing `jr field options`'s M1/M2 label-resolution normalizer (`cross-cutting.md`). BC-X.14.003 is cited as a cross-reference only because this story's fix changes what feeds INTO its rendering contract, not the contract itself (AC-005 traces to it to make that boundary explicit and count-neutral).

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001 (traces to BC-X.14.001 Behavior -- M1/M2 label-resolution fallback, EC-X.14.001-8..11)
`src/cli/field.rs::normalize_from_allowed_values_at_depth` sets `label = v.value.clone().or_else(|| v.name.clone())` (presence-based, not emptiness-based) at every depth of the cascading-option tree, for the four combinations {value-only, name-only, both, neither} at both the top level and at least one cascading child level.
**Test:** VP-580-013's example matrix (1).

### AC-002 (traces to BC-X.14.001 EC-X.14.001-12)
A wire `"value": ""` (present-but-empty string) wins over a populated `name` -- `label: Some(String::new())`, never falling through to `name` merely because the value string is empty. A wire `"value": null` deserializes to `AllowedValue.value: None`, which DOES fall through to `name`.
**Test:** VP-580-013's JSON-deserialized `"value": ""` and `"value": null` cells.

### AC-003 (traces to BC-X.14.001 EC-X.14.001-13, BC-X.14.002's unchanged `--value` contract)
`jr field options --value <substring>` (BC-X.14.002, its own contract unchanged) now also matches system-field option names via the fallback label, as a downstream consequence of AC-001 -- not a new filter rule.
**Test:** VP-580-013(5), a `priority`-shaped fixture run through `src/cli/field.rs::filter_options`/`filter_one`.

### AC-004 (traces to BC-X.14.001 "M3 is UNCHANGED and ALREADY CORRECT" paragraph)
`src/cli/field.rs::normalize_from_valid_values` (M3, JSM requesttype-fields) is NOT modified by this story and does NOT acquire a `name`-fallback of its own -- it already reads `.value` for id and `.label` for display, which was already correct before this story.
**Test:** VP-580-013(4), an M3 regression against a hand-written expected output: a `{value, name}` input entry (no `label` on M3's own wire shape) still yields `label: None` after this story's change, proving the fallback does not leak into M3.

### AC-005 (traces to BC-X.14.003 UPDATED blockquote, COUNT-NEUTRAL)
The rendering contract for a `None` label (`"(unnamed)"` in table output, `null` in `--output json`) is byte-for-byte UNCHANGED by this story -- only the upstream normalizer (AC-001) now produces fewer `None` labels for system fields.
**Test:** existing BC-X.14.003 rendering tests pass unmodified (regression guard, no new test needed).

### AC-006 (traces to prd-delta.md F4 stale-wording obligation, PASS-9/13/33, P9-002/P13-002/P33-002)
The following stale "custom field" / "`partial_match`" wording is corrected in the SAME commit as AC-001, since after this fix the command also serves system fields, not custom fields only, and field-name resolution has never actually gone through `partial_match` (a pre-existing, unrelated spec/code drift already corrected at cycle-014 F2 in `cross-cutting.md`, not re-litigated here):
- `src/cli/mod.rs`: the `Command::Field` about-text (~L128, "Discover custom-field allowed options"), the `FieldCommand::Options` about-text (~L1224, "Enumerate a custom field's allowed options"), and the `field` doc comment (~L1231-1232, "resolved via `list_fields()` + `partial_match`")
- `src/cli/field.rs`: the module doc comment (L1, "enumerate a custom field's allowed options") and the `handle` Step 2 comment (~L132, "resolved via the per-profile fields cache / `list_fields()` + `partial_match`")
- `src/api/jira/issues.rs::get_createmeta_fields`'s doc comment (~L1130, "Enumerate a custom field's allowed options...")
- `tests/field_options.rs`'s comments (~L1436 section banner, ~L2050)
- `README.md`'s `jr field options <NAME>` row (~L346)
- `CLAUDE.md`'s `field.rs` file-tree line (~L61)
**Test:** N/A (doc-accuracy); presence checked at PR review. This changes `jr field options --help` output text -- cosmetic, not a behavior change.

### AC-007 (traces to prd-delta.md F4 obligation PASS-8, P8-002)
`tests/field_options.rs::test_bc_x_14_001_field_name_human_name_resolves_via_partial_match` is renamed to a name reflecting `search_field_list` (the actual resolution algorithm -- single exact match auto-resolves; multiple exact -> exit 64; else single substring auto-resolves; multiple substring -> exit 64), and its doc comment is corrected to match.
**Test:** the renamed test itself, run green.

### AC-008 (traces to BC-X.14.001 EC-X.14.001-14, informational -- documented for completeness, no dedicated VP cell)
System-typed field NAME resolution (the step upstream of the label fallback, e.g. resolving the string `"Priority"` to a field id) is pre-existing `search_field_list`/`resolve_field_id` behavior, unaffected by this story's label-resolution fix. No new test is added for this AC; existing `search_field_list` unit tests already cover it as a regression guard.
**Test:** N/A (informational); existing `test_bc_x_14_001_search_field_list_*` unit tests continue passing unmodified.

## Architecture Mapping

| Component | Module | Pure/Effectful |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| `normalize_from_allowed_values_at_depth` | `src/cli/field.rs` | Pure (no I/O; struct-to-struct transform) |
| `normalize_from_valid_values` (M3, unchanged) | `src/cli/field.rs` | Pure (regression guard only) |
| `filter_options` / `filter_one` | `src/cli/field.rs` | Pure (unchanged contract, new downstream matches) |
| `AllowedValue` doc comments | `src/types/jira/editmeta.rs` | N/A (documentation only) |

Reference: `architecture/module-decomposition.md`, `architecture/dependency-graph.md` (no module-boundary change; F1 confirmed no architecture delta; this story is entirely within `src/cli/field.rs`'s existing pure-core normalizer).

## Edge Cases

| ID | Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----|----------|--------------------|
| EC-X.14.001-8 | `{value: Some(v), name: None}` | `label: Some(v)` (unchanged from pre-fix behavior) |
| EC-X.14.001-9 | `{value: None, name: Some(n)}` | `label: Some(n)` (NEW -- was `None`/`"(unnamed)"` before this story) |
| EC-X.14.001-10 | `{value: Some(v), name: Some(n)}` | `label: Some(v)` (`value` wins when both present) |
| EC-X.14.001-11 | `{value: None, name: None}` | `label: None` (unchanged; still renders `"(unnamed)"`/`null`) |
| EC-X.14.001-12 | `{value: Some(""), name: Some(n)}` (presence, not emptiness) | `label: Some("")`, never `Some(n)`; a wire `"value": null` still falls through to `name` |
| EC-X.14.001-13 | `--value` filter against a system field | Matches via the fallback label as a downstream consequence, not a new filter rule |
| EC-X.14.001-14 | System-field NAME resolution (informational) | Pre-existing `search_field_list` behavior, unaffected |

## Purity Classification

| Module | Classification | Justification |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `normalize_from_allowed_values_at_depth` (`src/cli/field.rs`) | pure-core | No I/O; the sole behavior-changing site in this story |
| `normalize_from_valid_values` (`src/cli/field.rs`) | pure-core | Unchanged; regression-guarded only |
| `filter_options` / `filter_one` (`src/cli/field.rs`) | pure-core | Unchanged contract; new matches are a downstream effect |

## Token Budget Estimate

| Context Source | Estimated Tokens |

| Referenced code (`src/cli/field.rs` normalizer region + `handle`'s Step 2, `src/types/jira/editmeta.rs::AllowedValue`, `src/api/jira/issues.rs::get_createmeta_fields` doc comment) | ~2,200 |
| Test files (`tests/field_options.rs` -- grep-scoped to the renamed test + the new VP-580-013 cells) | ~1,800 |
| Tool output overhead | ~1,000 |
| **Total** | **~7,800** |

## Previous Story Intelligence

| Story | Key Decisions | Patterns Established | Gotchas Discovered |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| S-cycle14-api-query-param (Wave 2, predecessor in the serial chain) | Rebase-before-PR discipline for a story sharing `src/cli/mod.rs`/README.md with earlier cycle-014 stories | Both stories touch `src/cli/mod.rs` in unrelated code regions -- confirm no merge conflict beyond line-adjacency before opening the PR | This story does NOT touch `.cargo/mutants.toml`/`docs/specs/cargo-mutants-policy.md` (no new function is added -- `normalize_from_allowed_values_at_depth` already exists and is already in `examine_globs` via `src/cli/field.rs`, FIX-F6-MUTANTS-SCOPE) -- do not add a redundant examine_globs entry |
| S-580-1 (delivered, cycle "field-dx" bundle, PR #740) | Original author of `normalize_from_allowed_values`/`_at_depth`, `filter_options`/`filter_one`, and the `FieldOption{id, label, children}` model this story amends | The `value`-only label read this story fixes was S-580-1's own original implementation; VP-580-005..012 already cover the rest of the M1/M2/M3 dispatch this story does not touch | S-580-1's own AC-011/architecture/EC text predates this cycle's BC-X.14.001 corrections (`search_field_list`, mirrored-not-shared with `field_resolve.rs`) -- it is NOT rewritten (delivered historical story); this story's AC-006/AC-007/AC-008 carry the corrected wording forward instead |

## Architecture Compliance Rules

| Rule | Source | Enforcement |
|------|--------|--------------|
| The fallback is READ-SIDE ONLY -- `src/cli/issue/field_resolve.rs::find_option_match`/`resolve_option_value` MUST NOT be touched by this story (write-side, out of scope per D-378) | BC-X.14.001 "Scope boundary -- READ-SIDE ONLY" paragraph | Code review; `src/cli/issue/field_resolve.rs` is not in this story's File Structure Requirements |
| M3 (`normalize_from_valid_values`) MUST NOT acquire a `name`-fallback of its own | BC-X.14.001 "M3 is UNCHANGED and ALREADY CORRECT" paragraph | AC-004's regression test |
| The fallback is presence-based (`Option::is_some`), never emptiness-based (`str::is_empty`) | BC-X.14.001 EC-X.14.001-12 | AC-002 |
| BC-X.14.002's `--value` filter contract itself is NOT modified -- only its INPUT (the label) changes | BC-X.14.002 (unaffected), BC-X.14.001 EC-X.14.001-13 | AC-003; no edit to `filter_options`'s matching logic itself |

## Library & Framework Requirements

No new dependency is added. No version pins change.

## File Structure Requirements

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `src/cli/field.rs` | modify | `normalize_from_allowed_values_at_depth`'s label fallback (AC-001, AC-002); module doc + Step 2 comment correction (AC-006) |
| `src/types/jira/editmeta.rs` | modify | `AllowedValue` struct-level and `name` field-level doc comments corrected (no functional change) |
| `src/api/jira/issues.rs` | modify | `get_createmeta_fields` doc comment correction (AC-006) |
| `src/cli/mod.rs` | modify | `Command::Field`/`FieldCommand::Options` about-text and help-text correction (AC-006) |
| `tests/field_options.rs` | modify | New VP-580-013 test cells (AC-001..004); rename + doc-comment fix (AC-007); comment corrections (AC-006) |
| `README.md` | modify | `jr field options <NAME>` row (~L346) wording correction (AC-006) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | modify | `field.rs` file-tree line (~L61) wording correction (AC-006) |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | modify | `[Unreleased] > Fixed` entry |
