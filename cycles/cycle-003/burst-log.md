# Burst Log — cycle-003 (auth-profile-dx)

## Burst: Burst 1 — cycle-003 OPENED (Feature Mode) — auth-profile-dx scope confirmed at architect gate (2026-09-01)

**Parent-commit:** `87f17aff` (`develop` tip; unchanged this burst — no `develop`-side commit; cycle-003 has not started implementation).

**Trigger:** human confirmed the auth-profile-dx feature bundle scope at a senior-architect gate, following grounded investigation of the existing auth/profile subsystem and modern-CLI auth/profile-design research (39 cited sources, 4 ranked decision recommendations). Opening this as cycle-003 — a new brownfield Feature Mode cycle on `jr` (jira-cli). cycle-001 (`list-read-ergonomics`) and cycle-002 (`field-dx`) remain CLOSED and historical, unaltered by this burst.

**Actions taken:**
1. STATE.md refreshed via one full-content Write (v3.30 → v3.31): frontmatter `phase` → `F1`, `pipeline` → `ACTIVE`, `current_cycle` → `"cycle-003"`, `feature_mode_bundle` → `auth-profile-dx`; `current_step` updated to describe cycle-003 OPENED, scope confirmed, F1 next. `cycle_001_status`/`cycle_002_status` preserved unchanged; added `cycle_003_status`.
2. Recorded 8 new Decisions Log entries, DEC-312 through DEC-319 (collision-checked: highest pre-existing ID was DEC-311, confirmed via corpus-wide grep — no collision): cycle-003 opened; `auth_method` as first-class intrinsic profile property; additive `env`/role tag on profile; per-profile credentials (api-token symmetric with OAuth, one-time keychain migration); API-token auth stays coequal/first-class; un-defer ADR-0011; 2LO service-account CI deferred; Device Authorization Grant rejected as design basis.
3. Added Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows for cycle-003 OPENED; replaced Session Resume Checkpoint (archived the prior SESSION-WRAP checkpoint to `cycles/cycle-002/session-checkpoints.md`).
4. Created cycle-003 scaffolding: this burst-log.md and `cycles/cycle-003/session-checkpoints.md`. `cycles/cycle-003/investigation/{auth-profile-current-state.md,modern-cli-auth-profile-research.md}` were already present in the worktree ahead of this burst (untracked) and are referenced from STATE.md's Historical Content table.
5. Did NOT touch `sidecar-learning.md` — a pre-existing uncommitted modification unrelated to this burst is left as-is per instruction; only cycle-003-init paths are staged explicitly for this commit.

**Adversary verdict:** N/A — bookkeeping/cycle-open burst (STATE.md + scaffolding only), no code or spec-body change; no `adversary` agent dispatched. The scope decisions this burst records were themselves reached via a human-confirmed architect gate, not an adversarial review pass.

**Outcome:** cycle-003 (`auth-profile-dx`) is OPEN, phase F1 (delta analysis) pending. No BC/VP/holdout counts changed (719/32/106) — this burst is scope-recording only, no spec authoring yet.

**NEXT:** dispatch F1 delta analysis (`/vsdd-factory:phase-f1-delta-analysis`) against the confirmed auth-profile-dx scope.

**Codifications:** none this burst — the 8 decisions are recorded in STATE.md's Decisions Log; no spec/BC/VP authored yet (that is F1/F2's work).

**Closes:** nothing. **Does NOT close:** any cycle-002 standing Drift/Standing Items — all carried forward unchanged in STATE.md.

### Counts reconciled this burst

No BCs/VPs/holdouts added or removed — 719 BCs / 32 VPs / 106 holdouts unchanged. `total_stories` unchanged at 161.

### Details

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| state-manager | Initialize cycle-003 in STATE.md (frontmatter, 8 Decisions Log entries DEC-312..DEC-319, Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows, Session Resume Checkpoint); create cycle-003 scaffolding (`burst-log.md`, `session-checkpoints.md`); archive final cycle-002 checkpoint; commit + push to factory-artifacts | `STATE.md`; `cycles/cycle-003/burst-log.md` (this file); `cycles/cycle-003/session-checkpoints.md`; `cycles/cycle-002/session-checkpoints.md` |

**Files touched (Dim-1): 4 unique files (factory-artifacts, this burst)**

- STATE.md
- cycles/cycle-003/burst-log.md
- cycles/cycle-003/session-checkpoints.md
- cycles/cycle-002/session-checkpoints.md

**Dim-2 Attestation:** `scripts/check-spec-counts.sh` / `scripts/check-bc-cumulative-counts.sh` — N/A this burst (no BC/VP/holdout count change; bookkeeping-only cycle-open, no `.factory/specs/prd/` or `BC-INDEX.md` edits).

**Dim-5 Attestation:** N/A — no binary/WASM artifact produced by this burst.

**Dim-6 Attestation:** N/A — no source code changed this burst (`.factory/` artifact bookkeeping only, no `develop`-side commit).

**Dim-7 Attestation:** N/A — no test-affecting change this burst; full regression remains PASS (4660/0/106) as of the cycle-002 F7 delta-convergence pass, unchanged.
