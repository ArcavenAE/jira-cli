# Skip Log — Archived Rows for Closed/Released Cycles (extracted from STATE.md)

> Extracted from `.factory/STATE.md`'s `## Skip Log` table during the
> 2026-09-10 `/compact-state` compaction (v4.03 -> v4.04). STATE.md keeps
> only the cycle-005/cycle-006 skip rows (its two most recent cycles); the
> rows below (cycle-002/003/004, all CLOSED + RELEASED, historical) are
> archived here verbatim, unedited.

| Step | Skipped? | Justification |
|------|----------|----------------|
| UX Spec (cycle-002) | yes | `jr` is a CLI-only product; field-dx bundle adds no UI surfaces. |
| DTU creation (cycle-002) | yes | `dtu_required: false` -- no external service behavior is being cloned by this bundle. |
| F5 secondary review-tier (Step 7, cycle-002) | yes | Every story already individually adversarially converged in F4; primary pass found only 1 low-likelihood MED + 4 LOW. |
| F6 Kani formal verification (cycle-002) | yes | Not set up in repo; proptest substitution justified (32/32 VPs covered, 0 GAP). |
| F6 cargo-fuzz (cycle-002) | yes | Not set up in repo; proptest arbitrary-input substitution justified (0 uncovered input surface). |
| F6 DTU adversarial testing / accessibility re-check (cycle-002) | yes | `dtu_required: false`; `feature_type: backend-cli`, no UI surface. |
| UX Spec (cycle-003) | yes | `jr` is CLI-only; auth-profile-dx confirmed no-UI-surface at F1/F2, same as cycle-002. |
| DTU creation (cycle-003) | yes | `dtu_required: false` -- auth flows target the real Atlassian OAuth/token endpoints already covered by existing DTU-not-required precedent. |
| Demo recording (cycle-003, Waves 4-5) | yes | Human decision (standing since post-PR#757): demos skipped for Wave 4's two stories and Wave 5's final story. |
| F6 Kani formal verification (cycle-003) | yes | Not set up in repo; proptest substitution justified -- VP-AUTHDX-001..009 all covered, 0 GAP. |
| F6 cargo-fuzz (cycle-003) | yes | Not set up in repo; proptest arbitrary-input substitution justified, same precedent as cycle-002. |
| UX Spec (cycle-004) | yes | `jr` is CLI-only; F1 delta-analysis explicitly confirmed `feature_type: backend (infrastructure; no UI)` across all 4 stories. |
| Demo recording (cycle-004, all 4 stories) | yes | Human decision this session: demos skipped for all cycle-004 stories (backend/Windows, no UI surface). |
| DTU creation (cycle-004) | yes | `dtu_required: false` -- #759's DPAPI-file fallback targets the OS keychain/filesystem, not a third-party service being cloned. |
| F6 Kani formal verification (cycle-004) | yes | Not set up in repo; proptest/unit substitution justified -- VP-AUTHDX-010..023 (all 14 new cycle-004 VPs) covered, 0 GAP. |
| F6 cargo-fuzz (cycle-004) | yes | Not set up in repo; proptest arbitrary-input substitution justified -- 0 uncovered input surface. |
| F6 DTU adversarial testing / accessibility re-check (cycle-004) | yes | `dtu_required: false`; `tenant_info` is a real endpoint, not a cloned DTU; `feature_type: backend`, no UI surface. |
| REQUIRED manual Windows-11 physical smoke test (cycle-004, Burst 21) | superseded, not skipped | Human explicitly authorized the `windows-latest` CI runner (PR #776) as the verification path instead of a physical machine -- see DEC-342. |
